This blog was built following the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) philosophy using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with its development being done at GitHub and now [publicly available](https://github.com/emanuelpina/blog) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/emanuelpina/blog/blob/master/LICENSE/). It's deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Keep in mind that the theme used was tailor-made, and if you decide to use it, you will probably have a lot of work to do to adjust it to your needs.

I am making the source code public so it can be useful to you, but also so it can be audited. So please, **if you find any typos, grammar or formatting errors, or any other issue that needs to be addressed, feel free to open a Pull Resquest**. On posts you can use the link `Edit` (below the title) to fix them directly on GitHub.

Enjoy and contribute :smile:
