Climate crisis is a fact. It's not something you choose to believe in or to deny. It's an emergency.

Because of human activity the world is changing at great pace and this time it's not for the better. We are no longer in time to avoid many of the drastic consequences of our aggressions to the planet, but we are still in time and have the responsibility to restrain them as much as we can.

The [Global Climate Strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net/) initiative is another attempt to raise awareness to the consequences of our actions, the policies of our governments and the imperative and urgent need for change.

For this initiative, the proposal is for millions of people around the world leave their homes and workplaces, on September 20th, to join the young climate strikers on the streets and demand an end to the era of fossil fuels.

You can use this [map](https://globalclimatestrike.net/#map) to find a climate strike near you, and if you're unable to strike on September 20th, [here](https://globalclimatestrike.net/organise/) are some other ways you can join the movement.
