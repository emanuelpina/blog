This is the source of my blog built following the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) philosophy with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Keep in mind that the theme used was tailor-made, and if you decide to use it, you will probably have a lot of work to do to adjust it to your needs.
